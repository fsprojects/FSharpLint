# MaxLinesInConstructor (FL0027)

## Cause

A class constructor is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a constructor becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have too many different responsibilities.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into private methods or functions.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInConstructor": { 
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100
            }
        }
    }
