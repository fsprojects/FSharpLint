# NoPartialFunctions (FL0066)

## Cause

A partial function was used.

## Rationale

Partial functions are only valid for certain inputs; for invalid inputs they will throw an exception. In most cases,
it is better to use a non-partial version of the function (e.g. `List.tryFind` instead of `List.find`) or use pattern matching,
so that you need to explicitly handle those cases which would cause an exception in the partial version.

## How To Fix

Use non-partial function or pattern matching.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "noPartialFunctions": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
              "allowedPartials": [],
              "additionalPartials": []
            }
        }
    }

* *allowedPartials* - list of strings representing partial functions to allow (e.g. `"List.tryFind"`).
* *additionalPartials* - list of strings representing additional partial functions to disallow.
