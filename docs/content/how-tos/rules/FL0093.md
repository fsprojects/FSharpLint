# DiscourageStringInterpolationWithStringFormat (FL0093)

*Introduced in `0.26.12`*

## Cause

String interpolation is done with String.Format.

## Rationale

The more idiomatic way to do string interpolation in F# is with the `sprintf` function, which is statically type-checked: the F# compiler will complain when too few arguments are supplied or its types don't match (unlike with String.Format), therefore allowing you to fail-fast (bring potential errors to compile-time instead of letting them be experienced by the user at run-time).

## How To Fix

Use sprintf instead of String.Format.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "discourageStringInterpolationWithStringFormat": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
