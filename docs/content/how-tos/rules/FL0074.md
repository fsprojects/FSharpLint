# FavourConsistentThis (FL0074)

*Introduced in `0.21.1`*

## Cause

Rule to detect inconsistent symbol used for the instance identifier (e.g. `this`).

## Rationale

Using the same symbol for the instance identifier (e.g. `this`, or `self`, or `instance`) aids readability.

## How To Fix

Replace all occurrences of the instance symbol used with the one configured in the rule settings (e.g. if using both `self` and `this` in the same codebase, decide which one to keep, and then only use one of them, not both).

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourConsistentThis": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "symbol": "this"
            }
        }
    }
