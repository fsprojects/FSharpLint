# FavourAsKeyword (FL0086)

*Introduced in `0.24.3`*

## Cause

A named pattern is used just to be compared in the guard against a constant expression e.g. `match something with | bar when bar = "baz" -> ()`.

## Rationale

The named pattern can be changed to an as pattern that uses a constant pattern, improving the pattern matching exhaustiveness check.

## How To Fix

Remove the guard and replace the named pattern with the as pattern using a constant pattern, e.g. change `match something with | bar when bar = "baz" -> ()` to `match something with | "baz" as bar -> ()`.
