# NoAsyncRunSynchronouslyInLibrary (FL0090)

*Introduced in `0.26.7`*

## Cause

`Async.RunSynchronously` method is used to run async computation in library code.

The rule assumes the code is in the library if none of the following is true:
- The code is inside NUnit or MSTest test.
- Namespace or project name contains "test" or "console".
- Assembly has `[<EntryPoint>]` attribute one one of the functions/methods.

## Rationale

Using `Async.RunSynchronously` outside of scripts and tests can lead to program becoming non-responsive.

## How To Fix

Remove `Async.RunSynchronously` and wrap the code that uses `async` computations in `async` computation, using `let!`, `use!`, `match!`, or `return!` keyword to get the result.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "noAsyncRunSynchronouslyInLibrary": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
