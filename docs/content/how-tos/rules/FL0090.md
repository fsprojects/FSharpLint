# NoAsyncRunSynchronouslyInLibrary (FL0090)

*Introduced in `0.26.7`*

## Cause

`Async.RunSynchronously` method is used to run async computation in library code. 

## Rationale

Using `Async.RunSynchronously` outside of scripts and tests can lead to program becoming non-responsive.

## How To Fix

Remove `Async.RunSynchronously` and wrap the code that uses `async` computations in `async` computation, using `let!`, `use!`, `match!`, or `return!` keyword to get the result.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "noAsyncRunSynchronouslyInLibrary": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
