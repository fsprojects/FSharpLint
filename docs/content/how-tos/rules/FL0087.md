# InterpolatedStringWithNoSubstitution (FL0087)

*Introduced in `0.26.8`*

## Cause

Interpolated string (with `$` prefix, such as `$"foo"`) is used without embedded F# expression (e.g. `$"{foo}"` where foo is some value).

Or string formatting function such as `sprintf` or `failwithf` is used without interpolation.

## Rationale

Usage of interpolated string without embedded F# expression(s) may indicate that the expression was intended to be used but wasn't used by mistake.

## How To Fix

Use regular string or embed F# expression using curly braces (`{}`).

Use `failwith` instead of `failwithf` if no formatting/interpolation is needed.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "interpolatedStringWithNoSubstitution": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
