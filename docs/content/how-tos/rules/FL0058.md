# TupleOfWildcards (FL0058)

## Cause

A constructor in a pattern has arguments that consist entirely of wildcards e.g. `SynPat.Paren(_, _)`

## Rationale

The tuple of wildcards can be replaced with a single wildcard.

## How To Fix

Replace the tuple with a single wildcard e.g. the example in the cause could be turned into `SynPat.Paren(_)`

## Rule Settings

    {
        "tupleOfWildcards": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
