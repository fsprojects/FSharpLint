# FavourSingleton (FL0089)

*Introduced in `0.26.10`*

## Cause

Rule to detect usage of lists or arrays with only one item.

## Rationale

`List.singleton foo`/`Array.singleton foo` is more readable and explicit than `[foo]`/`[|foo|]`.
Especially if we take in account that F# newbies may not yet be familiar with the difference between
inline array vs list instantiation; and square brackets with only one element could potentially be
confused with an indexing accessor.

## How To Fix

Replace all occurrences of single member lists/arrays with a call to List.singleton/Array.singleton.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourSingleton": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
