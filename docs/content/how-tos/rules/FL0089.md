# FavourSingleton (FL0089)

*Introduced in `0.26.10`*

## Cause

Rule to detect usage of lists or arrays with only one item.

## Rationale

List.singleton/Array.singleton is more readable and explicit than [ foo]/[| foo |].

## How To Fix

Replace all occurrences of single member lists/arrays with a call to List.singleton/Array.singleton.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourSingleton": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
