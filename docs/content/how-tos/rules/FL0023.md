# MaxLinesInMatchLambdaFunction (FL0023)

## Cause

A match function is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a function becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have too many different responsibilities.

## How To Fix

Use active patterns to help reduce the number of matches/extract code out into composable functions.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInMatchLambdaFunction": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100
            }
        }
    }
