# DisallowShadowing (FL0092)

*Introduced in `0.26.12`*

## Cause

A variable or parameter shadows another one with the same name.

## Rationale

Sometimes shadowing can cause confusion. Especially, if the developer is new to F#, or to functional programming in general, she might have trouble differentiating it from mutation.

## How To Fix

Rename varaible or parameter in question so it has unique name in its scope.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "disallowShadowing": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
