# AvoidTooShortNames (FL0075)

*Introduced in `0.21.1`*

## Cause

Rule to detect too short names.

## Rationale

Name represents information. It helps to improve code quality particularly during debugging. Name that is too short gives poor information about what it represents.

## How To Fix

Use longer names for the flagged occurrences.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "avoidTooShortNames": { "enabled": false }
    }
