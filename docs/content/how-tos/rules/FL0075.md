# CSharpFriendlyAsyncOverload (FL0075)

*Introduced in `0.21.1`*

## Cause

Rule to suggest adding C#-friendly async overloads.

## Rationale

Exposing public async APIs in a C#-friendly manner for better C# interoperability.

## How To Fix

Add an `Async`-suffixed version of the API that returns a `Task<'T>`

## Rule Settings

    {
        "csharpFriendlyAsyncOverload": {
           "enabled": false
        }
    }
