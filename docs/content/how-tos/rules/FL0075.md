# AvoidTooShortNames (FL0075)

*Introduced in `0.21.1`*

## Cause

Name used for element (symbol, variable, member, parameter) is too short.

## Rationale

Names represent information. Names that are too short give poor information about what they represent.

## How To Fix

Use longer names for the flagged occurrences.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "avoidTooShortNames": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
