# MaxLinesInEnum (FL0031)

## Cause

An enum is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a enum becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that all the items may not be related.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into smaller enums.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInEnum": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 500,
                "skipBlankLines": false,
                "skipComments": false
            }
        }
    }

*Introduced in `0.23.0`:*

The default setting will be false if the option is not provided in the Rule Settings:
* *skipBlankLines* - A boolean property that determines whether blank lines will be skipped. (Default false)
* *skipComments* - A boolean property that determines whether commented lines will be skipped. (Default false)
