# FailwithBadUsage (FL0073)

*Introduced in `0.20.3`*

## Cause

Rule to detect usage of `raise ex` instead of `reraise()` inside `try...with|ex` blocks.

## Rationale

Using `raise ex` to re-raise an exception is bad as it loses valuable stacktrace information from the original exception.

## How To Fix

Use `reraise()` instead of `raise ex` inside `try...with|ex` blocks.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourReRaise": {
           "enabled": true
        }
    }
