# MaxCharactersOnLine (FL0060)

## Cause

More than a configurable number of characters were on a single line.

## Rationale

Too many characters on a single line make code harder to read by forcing the reader to scroll horizontally.

## How To Fix

Break the line up into multiple lines.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxCharactersOnLine": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxCharactersOnLine": 120
            }
        }
    }
