# FavourNonMutablePropertyInitialization (FL0077)

*Introduced in `0.21.3`*

## Cause

Use of mutation to initialize properties with values.

## Rationale

There's no need to use mutation to initialize properties with values because F# has specific syntax for this kind of intitialization.
Both approaches will compile to the same IL but non-mutable code looks better because it doesn't look unsafe.

## How To Fix

Replace all occurrences of mutable property initialization with non mutable property initialization.
Example: `Cookie(Domain = "example.com")` instead of `let c = Cookie(); c.Domain <- "example.com"`

## Rule Settings

    {
        "FavourNonMutablePropertyInitialization": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
