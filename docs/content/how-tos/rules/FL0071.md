# CyclomaticComplexity (FL0071)

*Reintroduced in `0.20.2`*

## Cause

The cyclomatic complexity of a function or method exceeds the configured maximum complexity threshold.

## Rationale

Cyclomatic complexity provides the number of linearly independent paths through a function or method. Metricating cyclomatic complexity is a requirement for many software product assurance activities prescribed in industry.

## How To Fix

The cyclomatic complexity of a function or method is incremented by the following contributors:
* conditional branching (`if`/`else`/`elif`)
* `match` cases (also applies to `function` pattern matching and `match!`)
* `for` (for...in) and `foreach` (for i in...to) expressions
* `while` expressions
* boolean operators within conditional expressions of the above, or within `when` expressions in the case of `match`

Reducing the cyclomatic complexity of a function typically involves decomposing the function into more sub-functions. The cyclomatic complexity calculated by this rule is limited to a single scope of a function or method, i.e. the cyclomatic complexity of a function `g` nested within function `f` is calculated independent of the complexity of `f` and will not contribute to the cyclomatic copmlexity of `f`.

## Rule Settings

There is a single setting applicable to the cyclomatic complexity, which is the maximum cyclomatic complexity.  

    {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
            "maxComplexity": 40
        }
    }
