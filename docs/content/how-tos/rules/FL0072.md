# FailwithBadUsage (FL0072)

*Introduced in `0.20.3`*

## Cause

Rule to detect bad usage of failwith.

## Rationale

Passing empty strings or duplicate messages to failwith statements makes it much harder to understand/locate & subsequently fix bugs. 
It's also true when exceptions are swallowed in try...with blocks.

## How To Fix

Do not pass an empty string or a duplicate message to failwith. 
Instead of swallowing exception messages in try...with blocks, pass the exception as an innerException parameter of a new Exception.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "failwithBadUsage": {
           "enabled": true
        }
    }
