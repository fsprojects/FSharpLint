# FavourNamesInDUMembers (FL0094)

*Introduced in `0.26.12`*

## Cause

Discriminated union case field is unnamed.

## Rationale

Fields in discriminated union cases can be declared either named or unnamed.

Unnamed:
```fsharp
type Data =
    | TwoParts of string * string
    | OnePart of string
```

Named:
```fsharp
type Data =
    | TwoParts of part1: string * part2: string
    | OnePart of part1: string
```

The latter is preferable because it conveys the purpose of each field and helps differentiate between fields, especially if they are of the same type.

## How To Fix

Add a field name to the discriminated union case field.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourNamesInDUMembers": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
