# FavourBasicControlFlow (FL0076)

*Introduced in `0.21.3`*

## Cause

Use of match clause when it is used in basic control flow.

## Rationale

Match clauses are more adequate for complex pattern-matching scenarios.
For simple comparisons, an if-then-else block makes terser code.

## How To Fix

Use if-else construct instead of match clause.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "favourBasicControlFlow": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
