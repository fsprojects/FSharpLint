# AvoidTypeHintSuffixesInNames (FL0076)

*Introduced in `0.21.2`*

## Cause

Use of type hints in names suffixes.

## Rationale

The similar practice that predates this was the Systems Hungarian notation dialect that consisted in adding a type-hint as a
prefix for variable names. While still debatable, this practice is not being used anymore because of the redundancy that it
brings (especially in statically typed languages); and using suffixes (instead of prefixes) is no different. This rule,
however, will not flag variables/constants, just type members, because they are the ones that have higher chances to be
affected by the biggest downside from this bad practice: possible inconsistency when the type is modified (and subsequent
need to modify the member name besides the type, which increases the brittleness factor of the API, especially when referring
to public members).

## How To Fix

Just remove the type hint suffix; example: a member named "NamesList" of type `List<string>` can simply be named "Names" (so
that in the future could be changed to a Seq or Array without the need to modify the name, or the risk of its name becoming
inconsistent).
