# Overview

FSharpLint is a static analysis tool for F#. Like many other software linters, it analyzes your source code (using both typed and untyped syntax trees) and highlights any violations of defined F# coding rules. There are various kinds of rules:

* **Conventions:** ensures that your API members follow project- or solution-wide naming conventions.
* **Smells:** warns about logic that may pose maintainability problems or potential downsides.
* **Formatting:** checks that code is indented and structured according to specified cosmetic standards.

The tool is configurable via JSON and can be run as a console app or as an MSBuild task. It also provides an interface for easy integration into other software.

The project aims to let the user know of problems through [matching user defined hints](./how-tos/rules/FL0065.html)
a la [HLint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/), and also by using custom rules written in F# similar to the rules
in [Mascot](http://mascot.x9c.fr/manual.html) and [StyleCop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/).

Using a `.fsproj` (F# project) or `.sln` / `.slnx` / `.slnf` (F# solution) file the tool will analyse all of the F# implementation files in the project/solution looking for
code that breaks a set of rules governing the style of the code. Examples of rules: lambda functions must be less than 6 lines long, class member identifiers must be PascalCase.

## Usage

FSharpLint can be used in several ways:

* [Running as dotnet tool from command line](./how-tos/install-dotnet-tool.html).
* [In VS Code using the Ionide-FSharp plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp).
* [In other IDEs (Visual Studio, Rider) as an MSBuild Task](./how-tos/msbuild-task.html).
* [In other editors through FsAutoComplete Language Server](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete)

### Example Usage

The following program:

    type ExampleInterface =
        abstract member print : unit -> unit

    [<EntryPoint>]
    let main argv =
        let x = List.fold (fun x y -> x + y) 0 [1;2;3]
        printfn "%d" x
        0

Run against the lint tool generates the following errors:

    FL0036: Consider changing `ExampleInterface` to be prefixed with `I`.
    Consider changing `ExampleInterface` to be prefixed with `I`.
    Error in file Program.fs on line 1 starting at column 5
    type ExampleInterface =
         ^

    FL0045: Consider changing `print` to PascalCase.
    Error in file Program.fs on line 2 starting at column 19
       abstract member print : unit -> unit
                       ^

    FL0034: If `( + )` has no mutable arguments partially applied then the lambda can be removed.
    Error in file Program.fs on line 6 starting at column 23
        let x = List.fold (fun x y -> x + y) 0 [1;2;3]
                           ^

Refactored using lint's warnings:

    type IExampleInterface =
        abstract member Print : unit -> unit

    [<EntryPoint>]
    let main argv =
        let x = List.fold (+) 0 [1;2;3]
        printfn "%d" x
        0

If we run lint again it will find a new error, it's worth running the tool until it no longer finds any errors:

    FL0065: `List.fold ( + ) 0 x` might be able to be refactored into `List.sum x`.
    Error in file Program.fs on line 6 starting at column 12
    let x = List.fold (+) 0 [1;2;3]
            ^

After refactoring again we have with no lint errors:

    type IExampleInterface =
        abstract member Print : unit -> unit

    [<EntryPoint>]
    let main argv =
        let x = List.sum [1;2;3]
        printfn "%d" x
        0

## Configuration Files

Configuration of the tool is done using JSON.
A single JSON file containing the default configuration for all rules
is [included inside of the software](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint/blob/master/src/FSharpLint.Core/fsharplint.json).

By default, FSharpLint will use the default configuration. You can override this to point
to a different file, for example by using the `--lint-config` flag in the dotnet tool.

See the [Rule Configuration page](./how-tos/rule-configuration.html) for more info.

## Suppressing rules in code

Rules can be disabled within the code using structured comments. See the [Suppressing Warnings](./how-tos/rule-suppression.html) page for more information.

## Running Lint From An Application

Install the [`FSharp.Core` nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharpLint.Core/).

The namespace `FSharpLint.Application` contains a module named `Lint` which provides several functions
to lint a project/source file/source string.
