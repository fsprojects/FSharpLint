# FSharpLint [![GitHub Actions Build Status](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)

FSharpLint is a style checking tool for F#. It points out locations where a set of rules on how F# is to be styled have been broken.
The tool is configurable via JSON and can be run from a console app, or as an MSBuild task. It also provides an interface to easily integrate the tool into other software.

The project aims to let the user know of problems through [matching user defined hints](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/how-tos/rules/FL0065.html) a la [HLint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/), and also by using custom rules written in F# similar to the rules in [Mascot](http://mascot.x9c.fr/manual.html) and [StyleCop](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop).

The tool in use (running as an MSBuild task with TreatWarningsAsErrors set to true):

## How to build

1. Make sure you've installed the .NET version defined in [global.json](global.json)
2. Run `dotnet tool restore` to install all developer tools required to build the project
3. Run `dotnet fake build -t Build` to build (which executes the `Build` target from the FAKE-based [build script](build.fsx))
4. To run tests use `dotnet fake build -t Test`
5. To build documentation use `dotnet fake build -t Docs`

## How to work with documentation

1. Make sure you've installed the .NET version defined in [global.json](global.json)
2. Run `dotnet tool restore` to install all developer tools required to build the project
3. Run `dotnet fake build` to build default target of [build script](build.fsx)
4. Build documentation to make sure everything is fine with `dotnet fake build -t Docs`
5. Go to docs folder `cd docs` and start Fornax in watch mode `dotnet fornax watch`
6. Your documentation should be now accessible on `localhost:8080` and will be regenerated on every file save
