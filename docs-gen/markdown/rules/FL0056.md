# WildcardNamedWithAsPattern (FL0056)

## Cause

A wildcard is given a name using the as pattern e.g. `match something with | _ as x -> x + y`

## Rationale

The wildcard and as pattern can be replaced with the identifier the value is to be bound to.

## How To Fix

Replace the wildcard with the identifier the wildcard is currently being bound to, e.g. change `match something with | _ as x -> x + y` to `match something with | x -> x + y`

## Rule Settings

    [lang=javascript]
    {
        "wildcardNamedWithAsPattern": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
