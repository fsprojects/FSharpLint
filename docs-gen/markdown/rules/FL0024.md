# MaxLinesInValue (FL0024)

## Cause

A statement binded to a value is made up of more than a configurable number of lines. 
For example the following would break the rule when the maximum number of lines is set to 4:

    let value = 
		let x = 7
		let y = 6
		let e = 5
		let r = 4
		r * y * e * x

## Rationale

The larger a value becomes the more complex it becomes.

## How To Fix

Refactor to extract out code into smaller composable functions.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInValue": { 
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100
            }
        }
    }
