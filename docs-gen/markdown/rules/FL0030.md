# MaxLinesInRecord (FL0030)

## Cause

A record is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a record becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that all the items may not be related.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into smaller composed records.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInRecord": { 
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 500
            }
        }
    }
