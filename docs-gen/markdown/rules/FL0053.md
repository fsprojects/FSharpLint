# MaxNumberOfMembers (FL0053)

## Cause

A class contains more than a configurable number of members (`maxItems`).

## Rationale

The class is likely to be doing too much and violating the single responsibility principle.

## How To Fix

Reduce the number of members in the class, e.g. extract them out to another class.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxNumberOfMembers": { 
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxItems": 32
            }
        }
    }
